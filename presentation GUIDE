## **CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION**

This chapter presents the background of the study, statement of the problem, conceptual framework, significance of the study, scope and limitations, definition of terms, and review of related literature.

## **BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education is important in preparing students for technology-based careers. One of its core subjects is computer programming, which helps develop problem-solving, logical thinking, and technical skills.

However, many ICT students experience difficulties in learning programming, such as understanding program logic, fixing syntax errors, and debugging. These challenges can affect students’ motivation, confidence, and performance. Because of this, it is important to study students’ learning experiences and motivation in programming to help improve teaching strategies and learning support.

## **STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM**

This study aims to explore the learning experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in learning programming. It also considers the demographic characteristics of the respondents, such as age and gender, which may influence their learning experiences and motivation.

---

## **STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM – QUESTION 1**

**What is the demographic profile of the respondents in terms of age and gender?**

This question identifies the age and gender of the ICT students involved in the study. This information helps determine whether learning experiences and motivation in programming vary based on demographic factors.

---

## **STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM – QUESTION 2**

**What are the learning experiences of ICT students in programming?**

This question focuses on how students experience learning programming, including classroom activities, teaching methods, and overall learning environment.

---

## **STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM – QUESTION 3**

**What challenges do ICT students encounter while learning programming?**

This question identifies common difficulties faced by students, such as syntax errors, logic formulation problems, and debugging, which may affect their motivation and learning.

---

## **STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM – QUESTION 4**

**What motivates ICT students to learn programming?**

This question aims to determine the factors that encourage students to learn programming, such as interest, goals, teacher support, and classroom activities.

---

## **STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM – QUESTION 5**

**How do students’ experiences influence their motivation in learning programming?**

This question explains how learning experiences and challenges affect students’ motivation, confidence, and willingness to continue learning programming.

---

## **CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK**

---

## **CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK – INPUT**

The input includes:

* Prior exposure to programming
* Learning challenges such as syntax errors, logic formulation, and debugging
* Classroom learning experiences, including teaching strategies, learning resources, and teacher support

These factors influence how students experience learning programming.

---

## **CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK – PROCESS**

The process includes:

* Teaching and learning strategies in programming
* Student engagement in hands-on programming activities
* Interaction between students and instructional support
* Data gathering through surveys and interviews

These processes show how students learn, practice, and overcome difficulties in programming.

---

## **CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK – OUTPUT**

The output of the study is:

* Students’ motivation in learning programming
* Improved engagement and learning outcomes in ICT subjects

The output will be finalized after analyzing the data collected from students.

---

## **SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY**
