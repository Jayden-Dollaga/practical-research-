## **An Explanation on ICT Student Learning Experience in basic programming at Senior High School's Located in Naic**

## **CHAPTER 1**

### **Background of the Study**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education plays a vital role in preparing students for technology-driven careers, especially in fields where problem-solving, logical reasoning, and technical skills are essential. One of the core components of ICT education is computer programming, which not only hones these skills but also encourages creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to systematically troubleshoot problems. Despite its benefits, many ICT students encounter challenges in learning programming, such as understanding complex concepts, debugging errors, and managing multiple programming tasks simultaneously. These difficulties can negatively affect students’ motivation, confidence, and academic performance, and may even influence their decision to continue pursuing ICT-related studies. Therefore, examining students’ experiences and motivation in programming is crucial to providing better guidance, instructional strategies, and learning support tailored to their needs.

Foreign studies show that ICT students face varying levels of motivation depending on their prior exposure to programming. For instance, Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, & Alnaser (2019) found that students who began learning programming before entering university tend to demonstrate higher intrinsic motivation and greater engagement in learning activities, whereas those introduced to programming for the first time at university often rely more on external motivation, such as grades or instructor pressure. These differences in experience significantly influence how students approach learning, manage challenges, and cope with academic demands. Consequently, students with less experience and lower motivation are more likely to encounter learning difficulties, perform poorly, or even drop out of ICT courses.

In the local context, a study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 revealed that Senior High School ICT students generally view programming as beneficial to their skills development. Despite this positive perception, students reported common challenges such as syntax errors, debugging problems, and difficulty understanding program logic. These challenges affect students’ learning experiences and motivation, indicating that programming remains a demanding subject even at the Senior High School level.

Given these findings, it is important to further examine the experiences and motivation of ICT students in learning programming. Understanding the factors that influence students’ learning experiences can help improve teaching strategies and provide better support for learners. This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in programming to better understand the challenges they face and how these affect their learning.

#### **Foreign Studies**

Kori, Pedaste, Leijen & Tõnisson (2016) examined ICT students’ motivation differences based on prior programming exposure. The research found that students who learned programming before university had higher motivation and better academic results than those who began programming only at university, suggesting that early experience influences learning success in ICT programs. "https://www.ijiet.org/vol6/709-T0021.pdf"

Qian & Lehman (2017) reviewed misconceptions and other difficulties in introductory programming courses. They reported that novice learners often struggle with syntax errors, conceptual misunderstandings, and strategic knowledge application, all of which hinder learning progress and reduce confidence. "https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3077618"

A 2022 study published in Frontiers in Education showed that students’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations affected their engagement in programming and computational thinking. Prior programming experience was strongly linked to higher intrinsic  and better learning outcomes. "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.948783/full"

Abdunabi (2024) found that programming self-efficacy and motivation predict academic success in ICT courses. Students with higher confidence and motivation demonstrated better performance and persistence in programming tasks. "https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1448912.pdf"

Cheah (2020) conducted a systematic review of programming learning difficulties and found that lack of problem-solving skills, poor instructional materials, and limited hands-on support contribute to learners’ struggles, which negatively affect motivation and engagement.

#### **Local Studies**

A study conducted in the 2023-2024 academic year at ACLC Antipolo analyzed the experiences of Senior High School ICT students when it came to learning basic programming. It was found that students found programming helpful but faced problems regarding syntax errors and debugging. It is recommended that more practice should take place.

Dela Cruz and Santos (2021) studied the challenges in programming among ICT students in the Senior High School level in the Philippines. The results indicated that the students were challenged in understanding program logic due to limited exposure and practice. It was concluded that guided instruction should be used to improve motivation.

Reyes and Molina  (2020) investigated the attitude of students towards programming at public senior high schools. Results indicated that while students were interested in ICT generally, they did feel anxious and quite unconfident in handling programming activities. The authors recommended a supportive learning environment.

Garcia (2019) investigated the learning experiences of ICT students in relation to programming performance. The results showed that the students with positive learning experiences demonstrated higher motivation and better school performances. The study identified the role of the teacher in shaping such experiences.

Flores and Ramirez (2022) investigated the motivational factors to programming among Filipino ICT students. The results indicated that teaching strategies, learning resources, and peer support were influential in motivating students. This study recommended improving instructional approaches to increase student engagement.

### **Synthesis of Related Literature**

The review of foreign and local studies suggests that programming is still a challenging course for ICT students because of lack of experience, motivation, and practical exposure. Foreign studies emphasize prior experience and intrinsic motivation, whereas in local studies, the experiences shared by Filipino Senior High School ICT students also point out difficulties in syntax, logic, and debugging. These findings justify the need for a study that will investigate students' learning experiences and motivation in programming, to which this study will answer.
