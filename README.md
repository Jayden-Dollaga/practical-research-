## **An Exploration of ICT Students’ Learning Experiences in Basic Programming at Senior High Schools Located in Naic**

## **CHAPTER 1**

### **Background of the Study**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education plays a vital role in preparing students for technology-driven careers, especially in fields where problem-solving, logical reasoning, and technical skills are essential. One of the core components of ICT education is computer programming, which not only hones these skills but also encourages creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to systematically troubleshoot problems. Despite its benefits, many ICT students encounter challenges in learning programming, such as understanding complex concepts, debugging errors, and managing multiple programming tasks simultaneously. These difficulties can negatively affect students’ motivation, confidence, and academic performance, and may even influence their decision to continue pursuing ICT-related studies. Therefore, examining students’ experiences and motivation in programming is crucial to providing better guidance, instructional strategies, and learning support tailored to their needs.

Foreign studies show that ICT students face varying levels of motivation depending on their prior exposure to programming. For instance, Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, & Alnaser (2019) found that students who began learning programming before entering university tend to demonstrate higher intrinsic motivation and greater engagement in learning activities, whereas those introduced to programming for the first time at university often rely more on external motivation, such as grades or instructor pressure. These differences in experience significantly influence how students approach learning, manage challenges, and cope with academic demands. Consequently, students with less experience and lower motivation are more likely to encounter learning difficulties, perform poorly, or even drop out of ICT courses.

In the local context, a study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 revealed that Senior High School ICT students generally view programming as beneficial to their skills development. Despite this positive perception, students reported common challenges such as syntax errors, debugging problems, and difficulty understanding program logic. These challenges affect students’ learning experiences and motivation, indicating that programming remains a demanding subject even at the Senior High School level.

Given these findings, it is important to further examine the experiences and motivation of ICT students in learning programming. Understanding the factors that influence students’ learning experiences can help improve teaching strategies and provide better support for learners. This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in programming to better understand the challenges they face and how these affect their learning.

### **Conceptual Framework**

This study is anchored on the idea that the learning experiences influence the students’ motivational in learning the Programming. The motivation of the students towards learning programming is very crucial in studying ICT subjects. When learners face challenges or a lack of background knowledge, their motivation can suffer in programming learning.

The prior experience of students with computer programming, the learning problems caused by computer programming activities and their classroom learning experiences are the independent variables of the study. Prior exposure refers to the programming experience students have prior to undertaking ICT subjects. The learning challenges include trouble with program logic, and syntax error behaviour and debugging. Moreover, the methods teachers utilize, learning resources available, and support provided by teacher determines the experience inside a classroom.

An independent variable gives students a lesson on programming, then the teacher applies different methods of teaching, and the student also participates in computer programming. Studetns get motivated and develop perception, attitude, and confidence towards programming.

The dependent variable of this study is the motivation of student learning programming.  The student will show his or her motivation through interest, persistence and willingness to engage in tasks related to programming.  Additionally, enhancing students’ motivation may help them become more engaged and learn more in an ICT subject. 

**Input**

* Prior exposure to programming
* Learning challenges in programming (syntax errors, logic formulation, debugging)
* Classroom learning experiences (teaching strategies, learning resources, teacher support)

**Process**

* Teaching and learning strategies in programming
* Student engagement in hands-on programming activities
* Interaction between students and instructional support
* Data gathering through survey questionnaires and interviews to assess students’ learning experiences, challenges, and motivation in programming.

**Output**
> my progress and not yet finalize
* Students’ motivation in learning programming
* Improved engagement and learning outcomes in ICT subjects

**Explanation**

The **Input-Process-Output (IPO)** model is used in this research to explain the process by which different factors affect the motivation of ICT students learning programming.

The **input variables** are the factors that could potentially influence the learning process of students learning programming. These factors include **prior experience with programming**, **learning difficulties**, and **learning experiences in the classroom**. Prior experience with programming is considered an input variable because students come from different backgrounds, and some students may have already gained knowledge of basic programming concepts, while others need further exposure and practice. Learning difficulties, including syntax errors, difficulties in expressing logic, and debugging, are also considered input variables because these are some of the difficulties that ICT students face, and if not addressed, could have a negative impact on their confidence and interest in programming. Learning experiences in the classroom, including teaching approaches, learning resources, and support from teachers, are also considered input variables because they have a direct impact on how students understand programming concepts and how their learning difficulties are addressed.

The **process** refers to how these input variables interact during the instruction and acquisition of programming knowledge. This involves the **teaching and learning processes** used by the instructors, student **participation in hands-on programming exercises**, and the **interaction between students and teaching assistance**. Through this process, students are able to apply their prior knowledge, develop programming skills, and attempt to overcome difficulties in learning. Hands-on exercises allow students to develop their skills through practice, while instructor assistance and support help students cope with difficulties and maintain their motivation. These classroom interactions influence students’ learning experiences and their perceptions of programming. As part of the process, data are gathered through survey questionnaires and interviews to obtain information on students’ demographic profile, learning experiences, challenges, and motivation in learning programming.

> the **output** is not yet specified because the study is still in the process of gathering data. The output will be specified after the completion of interviews and the analysis of students’ responses. However, the framework argues that the interaction between the input and process variables will provide understanding of students’ motivation in learning programming.
