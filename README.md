## **An Exploration of ICT Students’ Learning Experiences in Basic Programming at Senior High Schools Located in Naic**

## **CHAPTER 1**

### **Background of the Study**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education plays a vital role in preparing students for technology-driven careers, especially in fields where problem-solving, logical reasoning, and technical skills are essential. One of the core components of ICT education is computer programming, which not only hones these skills but also encourages creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to systematically troubleshoot problems. Despite its benefits, many ICT students encounter challenges in learning programming, such as understanding complex concepts, debugging errors, and managing multiple programming tasks simultaneously. These difficulties can negatively affect students’ motivation, confidence, and academic performance, and may even influence their decision to continue pursuing ICT-related studies. Therefore, examining students’ experiences and motivation in programming is crucial to providing better guidance, instructional strategies, and learning support tailored to their needs.

Foreign studies show that ICT students face varying levels of motivation depending on their prior exposure to programming. For instance, Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, & Alnaser (2019) found that students who began learning programming before entering university tend to demonstrate higher intrinsic motivation and greater engagement in learning activities, whereas those introduced to programming for the first time at university often rely more on external motivation, such as grades or instructor pressure. These differences in experience significantly influence how students approach learning, manage challenges, and cope with academic demands. Consequently, students with less experience and lower motivation are more likely to encounter learning difficulties, perform poorly, or even drop out of ICT courses.

In the local context, a study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 revealed that Senior High School ICT students generally view programming as beneficial to their skills development. Despite this positive perception, students reported common challenges such as syntax errors, debugging problems, and difficulty understanding program logic. These challenges affect students’ learning experiences and motivation, indicating that programming remains a demanding subject even at the Senior High School level.

Given these findings, it is important to further examine the experiences and motivation of ICT students in learning programming. Understanding the factors that influence students’ learning experiences can help improve teaching strategies and provide better support for learners. This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in programming to better understand the challenges they face and how these affect their learning.

### **Statement of the Problem**

This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in learning programming.

Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:

1. What are the learning experiences of ICT students in programming?
2. What challenges do ICT students encounter while learning programming?
3. What motivates ICT students to learn programming?
4. How do students’ experiences influence their motivation in learning programming?

---

### **Conceptual Framework**

This study is anchored on the idea that students’ learning experiences significantly influence their motivation in learning programming. Learning programming in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) subjects requires not only technical skills but also sustained motivation and positive learning experiences. When students encounter difficulties or lack prior exposure, their motivation may decrease, which can affect their engagement and overall learning outcomes.

The **independent variables** of the study consist of students’ prior exposure to programming, learning challenges encountered during programming activities, and classroom learning experiences. Prior exposure refers to whether students have experience with programming before taking ICT subjects. Learning challenges include difficulties in understanding program logic, syntax errors, and debugging tasks. Classroom learning experiences involve teaching strategies, availability of learning resources, and the level of support provided by teachers.

These independent variables undergo a **process** that involves students’ interaction with programming lessons, instructional strategies used by teachers, and the students’ engagement in hands-on programming activities. Through this process, students form perceptions, attitudes, and confidence toward programming, which shape their motivation.

The **dependent variable** of the study is students’ motivation in learning programming. Motivation is reflected in students’ interest, persistence, and willingness to engage in programming tasks. Increased motivation is expected to lead to better engagement and improved learning outcomes in ICT subjects.

**Input**

* Prior exposure to programming
* Learning challenges in programming (syntax errors, logic formulation, debugging)
* Classroom learning experiences (teaching strategies, learning resources, teacher support)

**Process**

* Teaching and learning strategies in programming
* Student engagement in hands-on programming activities
* Interaction between students and instructional support

**Output**

* Students’ motivation in learning programming
* Improved engagement and learning outcomes in ICT subjects
