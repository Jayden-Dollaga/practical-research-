## **An Explanation on ICT Student Learning Experience in basic programming at Senior High School's Located in Naic**

## **CHAPTER 1**

### **Background of the Study**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education plays a vital role in preparing students for technology-driven careers, especially in fields where problem-solving, logical reasoning, and technical skills are essential. One of the core components of ICT education is computer programming, which not only hones these skills but also encourages creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to systematically troubleshoot problems. Despite its benefits, many ICT students encounter challenges in learning programming, such as understanding complex concepts, debugging errors, and managing multiple programming tasks simultaneously. These difficulties can negatively affect students’ motivation, confidence, and academic performance, and may even influence their decision to continue pursuing ICT-related studies. Therefore, examining students’ experiences and motivation in programming is crucial to providing better guidance, instructional strategies, and learning support tailored to their needs.

Foreign studies show that ICT students face varying levels of motivation depending on their prior exposure to programming. For instance, Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, & Alnaser (2019) found that students who began learning programming before entering university tend to demonstrate higher intrinsic motivation and greater engagement in learning activities, whereas those introduced to programming for the first time at university often rely more on external motivation, such as grades or instructor pressure. These differences in experience significantly influence how students approach learning, manage challenges, and cope with academic demands. Consequently, students with less experience and lower motivation are more likely to encounter learning difficulties, perform poorly, or even drop out of ICT courses.

In the local context, a study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 revealed that Senior High School ICT students generally view programming as beneficial to their skills development. Despite this positive perception, students reported common challenges such as syntax errors, debugging problems, and difficulty understanding program logic. These challenges affect students’ learning experiences and motivation, indicating that programming remains a demanding subject even at the Senior High School level.

Given these findings, it is important to further examine the experiences and motivation of ICT students in learning programming. Understanding the factors that influence students’ learning experiences can help improve teaching strategies and provide better support for learners. This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in programming to better understand the challenges they face and how these affect their learning.

### **Statement of the Problem**

This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in learning programming.

Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:

1. What are the learning experiences of ICT students in programming?
2. What challenges do ICT students encounter while learning programming?
3. What motivates ICT students to learn programming?
4. How do students’ experiences influence their motivation in learning programming?

---

### **Conceptual Framework**

This study is anchored on the idea that students’ learning experiences influence their motivation in learning programming. The independent variables include students’ prior exposure to programming, learning challenges, and classroom experiences. These factors affect the dependent variable, which is the students’ motivation in learning programming. Motivation, in turn, influences students’ engagement and learning outcomes in ICT subjects.

Specifically, this study aims to:

1. Describe the learning experiences of ICT students in programming.
2. Identify the common challenges faced by ICT students in programming.
3. Determine the factors that influence students’ motivation in learning programming.
4. Analyze how students’ experiences affect their motivation and learning outcomes.

### **Definition of Terms**

**ICT (Information and Communication Technology)** – Refers to the academic strand that focuses on computer systems, programming, and digital technologies.

**Programming** – The process of creating instructions that a computer follows to perform specific tasks.

**Motivation** – The factors that influence students’ interest, effort, and persistence in learning programming.

**Learning Experience** – The students’ encounters, challenges, and perceptions while studying programming.

### **Review of Related Literature**
This chapter presents related foreign and local studies that support the present research and provide background information on ICT students’ experiences and motivation in learning programming.

#### **Foreign Studies**

Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, and Alnaser (2019) examined the motivation of ICT students with and without prior programming experience. The study revealed that students who learned programming earlier showed higher motivation and engagement, while beginners relied more on external motivation. The researchers concluded that prior experience significantly affects learning outcomes in ICT education.

Ryan and Deci (2017) discussed the role of motivation in academic learning using Self-Determination Theory. Their findings showed that intrinsically motivated students perform better and persist longer in complex subjects such as programming. The study emphasized that external motivation alone is insufficient for sustained learning.

Lahtinen, Ala-Mutka, and Järvinen (2005) investigated difficulties encountered by students in learning programming. Results showed that beginners struggled most with syntax, logic formulation, and debugging. These difficulties negatively affected students’ confidence and motivation.

Robins, Rountree, and Rountree (2003) studied how novice programmers learn programming concepts. The study found that many students experience cognitive overload when learning programming, leading to confusion and frustration. The researchers emphasized the need for supportive teaching strategies to improve learning experiences.

Gomes and Mendes (2007) explored factors contributing to failure in introductory programming courses. The study revealed that lack of practice, poor problem-solving skills, and low motivation were major reasons for students’ difficulties. The authors suggested curriculum improvements to reduce dropout rates.

#### **Local Studies**

A study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 examined Senior High School ICT students’ experiences in learning basic programming. The findings showed that students viewed programming as beneficial but faced challenges such as syntax errors and debugging difficulties. The study recommended increased hands-on practice.

Dela Cruz and Santos (2021) investigated programming challenges among Senior High School ICT students in the Philippines. Results indicated that students struggled with understanding program logic due to limited exposure and practice. The study emphasized the importance of guided instruction to improve motivation.

Reyes and Molina (2020) explored students’ attitudes toward programming in public senior high schools. The study found that while students were interested in ICT, many experienced anxiety and low confidence when dealing with programming tasks. Supportive learning environments were recommended.

Garcia (2019) examined the learning experiences of ICT students in relation to programming performance. The findings showed that students with positive learning experiences demonstrated higher motivation and better academic results. The study highlighted the role of teachers in shaping these experiences.

Flores and Ramirez (2022) studied factors affecting motivation in programming among Filipino ICT students. The results revealed that teaching strategies, learning resources, and peer support significantly influenced students’ motivation. The study recommended improving instructional approaches to enhance engagement.

### **Synthesis of Related Literature**

The reviewed foreign and local studies show that programming remains a challenging subject for ICT students due to factors such as lack of experience, motivation, and practical exposure. Foreign studies emphasize the importance of prior experience and intrinsic motivation, while local studies confirm that Filipino Senior High School ICT students face similar difficulties, particularly in syntax, logic, and debugging. These findings support the need to examine students’ learning experiences and motivation in programming, which the present study seeks to address.
