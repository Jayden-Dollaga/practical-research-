## **An Exploration of ICT Students’ Learning Experiences in Basic Programming at Senior High Schools Located in Naic**

## **CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION**

### **Background of the Study**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education plays a vital role in preparing students for technology-driven careers, especially in fields where problem-solving, logical reasoning, and technical skills are essential. One of the core components of ICT education is computer programming, which not only hones these skills but also encourages creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to systematically troubleshoot problems. Despite its benefits, many ICT students encounter challenges in learning programming, such as understanding complex concepts, debugging errors, and managing multiple programming tasks simultaneously. These difficulties can negatively affect students’ motivation, confidence, and academic performance, and may even influence their decision to continue pursuing ICT-related studies. Therefore, examining students’ experiences and motivation in programming is crucial to providing better guidance, instructional strategies, and learning support tailored to their needs.

Foreign studies show that ICT students face varying levels of motivation depending on their prior exposure to programming. For instance, Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, & Alnaser (2019) found that students who began learning programming before entering university tend to demonstrate higher intrinsic motivation and greater engagement in learning activities, whereas those introduced to programming for the first time at university often rely more on external motivation, such as grades or instructor pressure. These differences in experience significantly influence how students approach learning, manage challenges, and cope with academic demands. Consequently, students with less experience and lower motivation are more likely to encounter learning difficulties, perform poorly, or even drop out of ICT courses.

In the local context, a study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 revealed that Senior High School ICT students generally view programming as beneficial to their skills development. Despite this positive perception, students reported common challenges such as syntax errors, debugging problems, and difficulty understanding program logic. These challenges affect students’ learning experiences and motivation, indicating that programming remains a demanding subject even at the Senior High School level.

Given these findings, it is important to further examine the experiences and motivation of ICT students in learning programming. Understanding the factors that influence students’ learning experiences can help improve teaching strategies and provide better support for learners. This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in programming to better understand the challenges they face and how these affect their learning.

### **Statement of the Problem**
This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in learning programming. **It also considers the demographic characteristics of the respondents, such as age and gender, as these factors may influence students’ learning experiences, challenges, and motivation in programming.**

Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:
1. What is the demographic profile of the respondents in terms of:
  a. Age
  b. Gender
2. What are the learning experiences of ICT students in programming?
3. What challenges do ICT students encounter while learning programming?
4. What motivates ICT students to learn programming?
5. How do students’ experiences influence their motivation in learning programming?

### **Conceptual Framework**

This study is anchored on the idea that the learning experiences influence the students’ motivational in learning the Programming. The motivation of the students towards learning programming is very crucial in studying ICT subjects. When learners face challenges or a lack of background knowledge, their motivation can suffer in programming learning.

The prior experience of students with computer programming, the learning problems caused by computer programming activities and their classroom learning experiences are the independent variables of the study. Prior exposure refers to the programming experience students have prior to undertaking ICT subjects. The learning challenges include trouble with program logic, and syntax error behaviour and debugging. Moreover, the methods teachers utilize, learning resources available, and support provided by teacher determines the experience inside a classroom.

An independent variable gives students a lesson on programming, then the teacher applies different methods of teaching, and the student also participates in computer programming. Studetns get motivated and develop perception, attitude, and confidence towards programming.

The dependent variable of this study is the motivation of student learning programming.  The student will show his or her motivation through interest, persistence and willingness to engage in tasks related to programming.  Additionally, enhancing students’ motivation may help them become more engaged and learn more in an ICT subject. 

**Input**

* Prior exposure to programming
* Learning challenges in programming (syntax errors, logic formulation, debugging)
* Classroom learning experiences (teaching strategies, learning resources, teacher support)

**Process**

* Teaching and learning strategies in programming
* Student engagement in hands-on programming activities
* Interaction between students and instructional support
* Data gathering through survey questionnaires and interviews to assess students’ learning experiences, challenges, and motivation in programming.

**Output**
> my progress and not yet finalize
* Students’ motivation in learning programming
* Improved engagement and learning outcomes in ICT subjects

**Explanation/Figure 1**

The **Input-Process-Output (IPO)** model is used in this research to explain the process by which different factors affect the motivation of ICT students learning programming.

The **input variables** are the factors that could potentially influence the learning process of students learning programming. These factors include **prior experience with programming**, **learning difficulties**, and **learning experiences in the classroom**. Prior experience with programming is considered an input variable because students come from different backgrounds, and some students may have already gained knowledge of basic programming concepts, while others need further exposure and practice. Learning difficulties, including syntax errors, difficulties in expressing logic, and debugging, are also considered input variables because these are some of the difficulties that ICT students face, and if not addressed, could have a negative impact on their confidence and interest in programming. Learning experiences in the classroom, including teaching approaches, learning resources, and support from teachers, are also considered input variables because they have a direct impact on how students understand programming concepts and how their learning difficulties are addressed.

The **process** refers to how these input variables interact during the instruction and acquisition of programming knowledge. This involves the **teaching and learning processes** used by the instructors, student **participation in hands-on programming exercises**, and the **interaction between students and teaching assistance**. Through this process, students are able to apply their prior knowledge, develop programming skills, and attempt to overcome difficulties in learning. Hands-on exercises allow students to develop their skills through practice, while instructor assistance and support help students cope with difficulties and maintain their motivation. These classroom interactions influence students’ learning experiences and their perceptions of programming. As part of the process, data are gathered through survey questionnaires and interviews to obtain information on students’ demographic profile, learning experiences, challenges, and motivation in learning programming.

> the **output** is not yet specified because the study is still in the process of gathering data. The output will be specified after the completion of interviews and the analysis of students’ responses. However, the framework argues that the interaction between the input and process variables will provide understanding of students’ motivation in learning programming.

This chapter presents related foreign and local studies that support the present research and provide background information on ICT students’ experiences and motivation in learning programming.

#### **Foreign Studies**

#### **1.1** 
Kori, Pedaste, Leijen & Tõnisson (2016) investigated how prior coding experience impacts first-year ICT students’ motivation and achievement. They found that students who learned programming before university tended to have higher motivation and significantly better grades than those beginning programming at university. For example, the experienced students earned higher weighted-average grades in their first semester. By contrast, novices were more driven by external incentives – the study reports that students new to programming showed higher “external regulation” (e.g. motivation from future job prospects) than those with prior experience. Together, these results suggest that early exposure to programming fosters a more intrinsic learning orientation and gives students an advantage in ICT studies.


#### **1.2** 
Qian & Lehman (2017) conducted a comprehensive literature review of beginner programmers’ misconceptions and difficulties. They report that novices frequently struggle across multiple dimensions: syntactic knowledge (grasping language syntax and rules), conceptual knowledge (understanding programming constructs and logic), and strategic knowledge (knowing how to approach and solve problems). These deep-seated misconceptions often lead to persistent errors and confusion. For instance, beginners may write code with syntax errors or misunderstand how loops and conditionals work, which in turn inhibits their ability to debug and learn effectively. In short, these intertwined difficulties slow students’ progress and can discourage learners in introductory programming courses.

#### **1.3** 
A study published in Frontiers in Education (2022) examined how programming motivation relates to student engagement and computational thinking (CT) skills. This research found that students with prior programming experience generally reported higher intrinsic motivation (interest/enjoyment) for coding, and this intrinsic motivation was linked to better CT outcomes. Specifically, high intrinsic programming motivation predicted higher CT test scores for students who already had coding experience, whereas for students without prior experience, higher extrinsic motivation (e.g. interest in external rewards) predicted better CT skills. In other words, prior coding experience seems to bolster a student’s internal drive and leads to stronger learning outcomes in programming and computational thinking.

#### **1.4** 
Abdunabi (2024) explored how programming self-efficacy and related factors predict success in IS/ICT courses. He notes that, according to expectancy-value theory, students’ expectations of success and the value they place on a task strongly predict their performance and persistence. The study’s data confirm this: students who highly valued learning programming tended to work more independently and persist longer when solving difficult coding problems. These findings imply that learners with higher programming confidence and motivation generally achieve better performance and stick with challenging programming tasks longer, thereby improving their academic outcomes.

#### **1.5** 
Cheah’s (2020) systematic review identifies multiple factors that make learning programming difficult and sap students’ motivation. She highlights that many learners simply lack the foundational problem-solving skills needed to break down programming tasks. In addition, traditional instructional materials often fail to convey programming concepts effectively – for example, static textbooks do not support the dynamic, visual nature of coding. Cheah also points out that limited hands-on support worsens the situation: when students are not actively involved in practical coding sessions, they struggle to understand concepts and quickly become disengaged. Altogether, poor problem-solving ability, inadequate instructional resources, and insufficient practical support combine to undermine novice programmers’ motivation and engagement.

#### **Local Studies**

#### **2.1** 
Palawan National School (2023) investigated the challenges faced by Grade 12 ICT students in learning programming, focusing on syntax errors and debugging difficulties. The study found that persistent errors often caused frustration, which reduced students’ engagement and made learning more difficult. Researchers observed that without timely feedback and support for correcting errors, students could develop negative attitudes toward programming, weakening their skills and confidence. To address these issues, the study recommended practical interventions such as implementing real-time debugging tools or extensions that provide immediate feedback, along with giving students more hands-on practice through exercises and tutorials. Additionally, they emphasized the importance of supportive learning resources to build students’ confidence and improve their overall proficiency in programming.

#### **2.2** 
Pasay City South High School (2023) examined the programming challenges experienced by Grade 11 ICT students. The study revealed that learners often struggled with identifying and fixing errors in their code, which caused frustration and a decline in motivation. Interviews indicated that students frequently spent excessive time troubleshooting a single bug, only to encounter additional issues, which compounded their discouragement. Factors such as limited access to computers and a rapid teaching pace further hindered their learning, leaving students feeling overwhelmed. The researchers recommended adopting student-centered teaching strategies, including slowing down the introduction of new topics, providing remedial sessions or tutorials, and encouraging collaborative group work. They also advised incorporating regular coding practice, guided tutorials, and better access to instructional resources to help students overcome these challenges and maintain motivation.

#### **2.3** 
Philippine Science High School (2019) conducted a case study on the programming competence and learning experiences of Grade 9 students. The findings indicated that although most students demonstrated overall capability, they still faced recurring difficulties with coding syntax and debugging. Students reported issues such as improper syntax and repeated trial-and-error attempts, which affected their confidence and slowed their learning progress. The study concluded that even competent learners benefit from additional practice exercises and targeted instruction to address persistent technical challenges. Providing focused guidance helps maintain both performance and self-assurance, ensuring that students continue to build their programming skills effectively.

#### **2.4** 
Young Achievers School of Caloocan (2021) explored the perspectives of Grade 11 ICT students regarding coding. The research showed that while students understood the importance of programming skills for their future careers, many experienced anxiety and low confidence when attempting coding tasks. These emotional factors often became barriers, as anxious students tended to freeze or give up when confronted with difficult problems. The study emphasized that these feelings of anxiety and self-doubt negatively impacted performance and suggested that psychological support, confidence-building exercises, and technical guidance are essential for fostering successful learning experiences among novice programmers.

#### **2.5** 
St. Matthew Academy of Cavite (2022) examined how programming instruction affects ICT students’ skills and motivation. The study found that students who received effective teaching and adequate support showed significantly higher engagement in programming. For example, experienced teachers providing clear explanations, ample practice materials, and opportunities for peer collaboration encouraged learners to work together, tutor one another, and participate more actively in coding exercises. The research concluded that combining well-structured teaching strategies with peer support not only improved students’ programming skills but also boosted their confidence and overall motivation to learn.
