## **An Exploration of ICT Students’ Learning Experiences in Basic Programming at Senior High Schools Located in Naic**

## **CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION**

### **Background of the Study**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education plays a vital role in preparing students for technology-driven careers, especially in fields where problem-solving, logical reasoning, and technical skills are essential. One of the core components of ICT education is computer programming, which not only hones these skills but also encourages creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to systematically troubleshoot problems. Despite its benefits, many ICT students encounter challenges in learning programming, such as understanding complex concepts, debugging errors, and managing multiple programming tasks simultaneously. These difficulties can negatively affect students’ motivation, confidence, and academic performance, and may even influence their decision to continue pursuing ICT-related studies. Therefore, examining students’ experiences and motivation in programming is crucial to providing better guidance, instructional strategies, and learning support tailored to their needs.

Foreign studies show that ICT students face varying levels of motivation depending on their prior exposure to programming. For instance, Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, & Alnaser (2019) found that students who began learning programming before entering university tend to demonstrate higher intrinsic motivation and greater engagement in learning activities, whereas those introduced to programming for the first time at university often rely more on external motivation, such as grades or instructor pressure. These differences in experience significantly influence how students approach learning, manage challenges, and cope with academic demands. Consequently, students with less experience and lower motivation are more likely to encounter learning difficulties, perform poorly, or even drop out of ICT courses.

In the local context, a study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 revealed that Senior High School ICT students generally view programming as beneficial to their skills development. Despite this positive perception, students reported common challenges such as syntax errors, debugging problems, and difficulty understanding program logic. These challenges affect students’ learning experiences and motivation, indicating that programming remains a demanding subject even at the Senior High School level.

Given these findings, it is important to further examine the experiences and motivation of ICT students in learning programming. Understanding the factors that influence students’ learning experiences can help improve teaching strategies and provide better support for learners. This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in programming to better understand the challenges they face and how these affect their learning.

### **Statement of the Problem**
This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in learning programming. **It also considers the demographic characteristics of the respondents, such as age and gender, as these factors may influence students’ learning experiences, challenges, and motivation in programming.**

Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:
1. What is the demographic profile of the respondents in terms of:
  a. Age
  b. Gender
2. What are the learning experiences of ICT students in programming?
3. What challenges do ICT students encounter while learning programming?
4. What motivates ICT students to learn programming?
5. How do students’ experiences influence their motivation in learning programming?

---

### **Conceptual Framework**

This study is anchored on the idea that the learning experiences influence the students’ motivational in learning the Programming. The motivation of the students towards learning programming is very crucial in studying ICT subjects. When learners face challenges or a lack of background knowledge, their motivation can suffer in programming learning.

The prior experience of students with computer programming, the learning problems caused by computer programming activities and their classroom learning experiences are the independent variables of the study. Prior exposure refers to the programming experience students have prior to undertaking ICT subjects. The learning challenges include trouble with program logic, and syntax error behaviour and debugging. Moreover, the methods teachers utilize, learning resources available, and support provided by teacher determines the experience inside a classroom.

An independent variable gives students a lesson on programming, then the teacher applies different methods of teaching, and the student also participates in computer programming. Studetns get motivated and develop perception, attitude, and confidence towards programming.

The dependent variable of this study is the motivation of student learning programming.  The student will show his or her motivation through interest, persistence and willingness to engage in tasks related to programming.  Additionally, enhancing students’ motivation may help them become more engaged and learn more in an ICT subject. 

**Input**

* Prior exposure to programming
* Learning challenges in programming (syntax errors, logic formulation, debugging)
* Classroom learning experiences (teaching strategies, learning resources, teacher support)

**Process**

* Teaching and learning strategies in programming
* Student engagement in hands-on programming activities
* Interaction between students and instructional support
* Data gathering through survey questionnaires and interviews to assess students’ learning experiences, challenges, and motivation in programming.

**Output**
> my progress and not yet finalize
* Students’ motivation in learning programming
* Improved engagement and learning outcomes in ICT subjects

**Explanation/Figure 1**

The **Input-Process-Output (IPO)** model is used in this research to explain the process by which different factors affect the motivation of ICT students learning programming.

The **input variables** are the factors that could potentially influence the learning process of students learning programming. These factors include **prior experience with programming**, **learning difficulties**, and **learning experiences in the classroom**. Prior experience with programming is considered an input variable because students come from different backgrounds, and some students may have already gained knowledge of basic programming concepts, while others need further exposure and practice. Learning difficulties, including syntax errors, difficulties in expressing logic, and debugging, are also considered input variables because these are some of the difficulties that ICT students face, and if not addressed, could have a negative impact on their confidence and interest in programming. Learning experiences in the classroom, including teaching approaches, learning resources, and support from teachers, are also considered input variables because they have a direct impact on how students understand programming concepts and how their learning difficulties are addressed.

The **process** refers to how these input variables interact during the instruction and acquisition of programming knowledge. This involves the **teaching and learning processes** used by the instructors, student **participation in hands-on programming exercises**, and the **interaction between students and teaching assistance**. Through this process, students are able to apply their prior knowledge, develop programming skills, and attempt to overcome difficulties in learning. Hands-on exercises allow students to develop their skills through practice, while instructor assistance and support help students cope with difficulties and maintain their motivation. These classroom interactions influence students’ learning experiences and their perceptions of programming. As part of the process, data are gathered through survey questionnaires and interviews to obtain information on students’ demographic profile, learning experiences, challenges, and motivation in learning programming.

> the **output** is not yet specified because the study is still in the process of gathering data. The output will be specified after the completion of interviews and the analysis of students’ responses. However, the framework argues that the interaction between the input and process variables will provide understanding of students’ motivation in learning programming.

### **Review of Related Literature**
This chapter presents related foreign and local studies that support the present research and provide background information on ICT students’ experiences and motivation in learning programming.

#### **Foreign Studies**

#### **1.1** 
Kori, Pedaste, Leijen, and Tõnisson (2016) investigated the impact of prior programming experience on the motivation and performance of first-year ICT students. The results revealed that students who had learned programming before university enrollment tended to be more motivated and performed significantly better in their studies compared to those who started programming at university. To illustrate, students with programming experience scored higher weighted average grades in their first semester. On the other hand, novices were more externally motivated; according to the study, students who were new to programming showed higher levels of external regulation, such as motivation due to future employment prospects, than those with prior programming experience. Taken together, these results suggest that introducing programming early leads to a more intrinsic form of motivation and provides an advantage in ICT studies.

#### **1.2** 
Qian & Lehman (2017) performed a literature review on misconceptions and difficulties encountered by novice programmers. They found that beginners often face difficulties in more than one dimension: syntactic knowledge (learning language syntax and rules), conceptual knowledge (learning programming concepts and logic), and strategic knowledge (learning how to solve problems). For instance, beginners may have syntax errors in their code or misunderstand the workings of loops and conditionals, which in turn affects their debugging and learning process. In short, these interrelated difficulties make it challenging for students to learn and may demotivate them in introductory programming classes.

#### **1.3** 
A research paper published in Frontiers in Education (2022) explored the link between programming motivation, student engagement, and computational thinking (CT) skills. The results showed that students with prior programming experience tended to have higher levels of intrinsic motivation (interest and enjoyment) towards programming, and intrinsic motivation was a predictor of superior CT performance. High intrinsic programming motivation was a predictor of high CT test scores among students with prior programming experience, while high extrinsic motivation (interest in external rewards) was a predictor of CT skills among students without prior programming experience. In conclusion, prior programming experience seems to boost a student’s internal motivation and improve programming and computational thinking performance.

#### **1.4** 
Abdunabi (2024) investigated the role of programming self-efficacy and its predictors in determining success in IS/ICT-related courses. The author states that, as per expectancy-value theory, students’ expectations of success and the value they place on a task are robust predictors of their performance. The findings of the study support this, as students who value learning programming highly are likely to be more self-sufficient in their efforts and continue for longer periods of time when dealing with complex programming tasks. This indicates that students who are more confident and motivated in programming are likely to perform better and continue with programming-related tasks for longer periods of time.

#### **1.5** 
Cheah’s (2020) systematic review identifies, there are a number of reasons that make learning programming difficult and reduce the motivation of the students. These include the fact that many students do not possess the basic problem-solving skills necessary for breaking down programming tasks. In addition, the traditional learning materials often do not communicate programming ideas effectively; for example, textbooks that do not support the dynamic and visual aspect of programming. Cheah further states that a lack of practical support makes the problem worse because, if students are not directly involved in coding activities, they will not be able to understand the concepts and will quickly lose motivation.

#### **Local Studies**

#### **2.1** 
Palawan National School (2023) analyzed the difficulties Grade 12 ICT students face in learning programming. The study concluded that when errors are persistent, it often results in frustration, thus reducing student engagement and making the learning process more complicated. The study observed that if students are not provided with feedback and support to overcome errors, they might develop a negative attitude towards programming, thus affecting their skills and confidence. To overcome these issues, the study suggested some effective solutions, such as the use of real-time debugging tools or extensions that provide immediate feedback, along with more hands-on experience through exercises and tutorials. Moreover, they emphasized the need for supportive learning materials to boost students’ confidence and improve their overall proficiency in programming.

#### **2.2** 
Pasay City South High School (2023) carried out a study to investigate the programming problems encountered by the Grade 11 ICT students. The findings of the study showed that the learners were often faced with problems of error identification and correction, which resulted in frustration and a loss of motivation. The interview analysis showed that the learners often spent too much time on error correction for a particular problem and then encountered more issues, which further contributed to their discouragement. The factors that contributed to this problem were the lack of computer availability and the fast pace of teaching, which further made learning difficult for the students. The study recommended the use of student-centered approaches to teaching, such as slowing down the pace of introducing new material, conducting remedial classes or tutorials, and encouraging group work.

#### **2.3** 
Philippine Science High School (2019) conducted a case study that focused on the programming skills and learning process of Grade 9 students. The results revealed that while most students showed overall competency, they still struggled with common problems related to coding syntax and debugging. The students experienced problems like incorrect syntax and trial-and-error approaches, which impacted their confidence levels and learning process. The study concluded that even competent students need more practice exercises to overcome common technical issues. Offering specific guidance enables learners to maintain their performance and confidence levels, thereby helping them enhance their programming skills effectively.

#### **2.4** 
Young Achievers School of Caloocan (2021) investigated the views of Grade 11 ICT students on coding. The study revealed that despite the students' awareness of the importance of coding skills for their future profession, they still felt anxious and lacked self-confidence when working on coding activities. These emotions often served as barriers because anxious students often froze or gave up when faced with difficult problems to solve. The study emphasized that the students' feelings of anxiety and lack of self-confidence negatively influenced their performance and that psychological assistance, building confidence, and technical assistance are needed to promote positive learning experiences for novice coders.

#### **2.5** 
St. Matthew Academy of Cavite (2022) carried out a research study to investigate the effect of programming instruction on the skills and motivation of ICT students. The study found that students who were taught effectively and supported well showed significantly higher levels of engagement in programming. Experienced teachers who provided clear explanations, practice materials, and collaboration opportunities motivated students to work together, tutor each other, and engage actively in programming tasks. The results of the study concluded that the integration of effective teaching strategies with peer support not only improved students’ programming skills but also boosted their confidence and motivation levels.
