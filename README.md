## **An Exploration of ICT Students’ Learning Experiences in Basic Programming at Senior High Schools Located in Naic**

## **CHAPTER 1**

### **Background of the Study**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education plays a vital role in preparing students for technology-driven careers, especially in fields where problem-solving, logical reasoning, and technical skills are essential. One of the core components of ICT education is computer programming, which not only hones these skills but also encourages creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to systematically troubleshoot problems. Despite its benefits, many ICT students encounter challenges in learning programming, such as understanding complex concepts, debugging errors, and managing multiple programming tasks simultaneously. These difficulties can negatively affect students’ motivation, confidence, and academic performance, and may even influence their decision to continue pursuing ICT-related studies. Therefore, examining students’ experiences and motivation in programming is crucial to providing better guidance, instructional strategies, and learning support tailored to their needs.

Foreign studies show that ICT students face varying levels of motivation depending on their prior exposure to programming. For instance, Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, & Alnaser (2019) found that students who began learning programming before entering university tend to demonstrate higher intrinsic motivation and greater engagement in learning activities, whereas those introduced to programming for the first time at university often rely more on external motivation, such as grades or instructor pressure. These differences in experience significantly influence how students approach learning, manage challenges, and cope with academic demands. Consequently, students with less experience and lower motivation are more likely to encounter learning difficulties, perform poorly, or even drop out of ICT courses.

In the local context, a study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 revealed that Senior High School ICT students generally view programming as beneficial to their skills development. Despite this positive perception, students reported common challenges such as syntax errors, debugging problems, and difficulty understanding program logic. These challenges affect students’ learning experiences and motivation, indicating that programming remains a demanding subject even at the Senior High School level.

Given these findings, it is important to further examine the experiences and motivation of ICT students in learning programming. Understanding the factors that influence students’ learning experiences can help improve teaching strategies and provide better support for learners. This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in programming to better understand the challenges they face and how these affect their learning.

### **Statement of the Problem**

This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in learning programming.

Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:

1. What are the learning experiences of ICT students in programming?
2. What challenges do ICT students encounter while learning programming?
3. What motivates ICT students to learn programming?
4. How do students’ experiences influence their motivation in learning programming?

---

### **Conceptual Framework**

This study is anchored on the idea that the learning experiences influence the students’ motivational in learning the Programming. The motivation of the students towards learning programming is very crucial in studying ICT subjects. When learners face challenges or a lack of background knowledge, their motivation can suffer in programming learning.

The prior experience of students with computer programming, the learning problems caused by computer programming activities and their classroom learning experiences are the independent variables of the study. Prior exposure refers to the programming experience students have prior to undertaking ICT subjects. The learning challenges include trouble with program logic, and syntax error behaviour and debugging. Moreover, the methods teachers utilize, learning resources available, and support provided by teacher determines the experience inside a classroom.

An independent variable gives students a lesson on programming, then the teacher applies different methods of teaching, and the student also participates in computer programming. Studetns get motivated and develop perception, attitude, and confidence towards programming.

The dependent variable of this study is the motivation of student learning programming.  The student will show his or her motivation through interest, persistence and willingness to engage in tasks related to programming.  Additionally, enhancing students’ motivation may help them become more engaged and learn more in an ICT subject. 

**Input**

* Prior exposure to programming
* Learning challenges in programming (syntax errors, logic formulation, debugging)
* Classroom learning experiences (teaching strategies, learning resources, teacher support)

**Process**

* Teaching and learning strategies in programming
* Student engagement in hands-on programming activities
* Interaction between students and instructional support

**Output**
> my progress and not yet finalize
* Students’ motivation in learning programming
* Improved engagement and learning outcomes in ICT subjects

**Explanation**

The chosen input variables based on which we can explore the issues affecting the learning of students in programming. The prior programming experience would be considered as an input variable since we assume the students are either able to master the basic programming concepts or they can be further exposed to the programming concepts and practice more. The issues students face concerning syntax errors, developing logic and debugging problems are also considered as an input variable as they are one of the problems ICT students face. Their confidence and interest can be directly impacted in programming. The classroom experiences constitute an input variable because they influence students’ understanding of the teaching content and the teacher’s attempts at rectifying their programming learning difficulties. For example, the teaching styles, availability of teaching aids, and teacher support can all influence students’ understanding.

The process is concerned with how the recognized input factors react in teaching and learning activities. Teaching and learning methods are used to show how teachers engage students in learning programming concepts and problem solving. Likewise, programming practical activities student experience exemplifies students’ involvement in programming practical activities. Engaging in hands-on tasks helps us rely on our past experiences while honing our skills. The concept of student teaching interaction and teacher support is intended to show the way that support systems help the learners in learning in overcoming difficulties. All of them about how the experiences of students are created in classrooms. The impact that the experiences of students have on learners’ motivation in learning further programming is explained.
