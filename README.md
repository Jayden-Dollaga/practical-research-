## **An Explanation on ICT Student Learning Experience in basic programming at Senior High School's Located in Naic**

## **CHAPTER 1**

### **Background of the Study**

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) education plays a vital role in preparing students for technology-driven careers, especially in fields where problem-solving, logical reasoning, and technical skills are essential. One of the core components of ICT education is computer programming, which not only hones these skills but also encourages creativity, critical thinking, and the ability to systematically troubleshoot problems. Despite its benefits, many ICT students encounter challenges in learning programming, such as understanding complex concepts, debugging errors, and managing multiple programming tasks simultaneously. These difficulties can negatively affect students’ motivation, confidence, and academic performance, and may even influence their decision to continue pursuing ICT-related studies. Therefore, examining students’ experiences and motivation in programming is crucial to providing better guidance, instructional strategies, and learning support tailored to their needs.

Foreign studies show that ICT students face varying levels of motivation depending on their prior exposure to programming. For instance, Al-Kabi, Alsmadi, & Alnaser (2019) found that students who began learning programming before entering university tend to demonstrate higher intrinsic motivation and greater engagement in learning activities, whereas those introduced to programming for the first time at university often rely more on external motivation, such as grades or instructor pressure. These differences in experience significantly influence how students approach learning, manage challenges, and cope with academic demands. Consequently, students with less experience and lower motivation are more likely to encounter learning difficulties, perform poorly, or even drop out of ICT courses.

In the local context, a study conducted at ACLC Antipolo during the school year 2023–2024 revealed that Senior High School ICT students generally view programming as beneficial to their skills development. Despite this positive perception, students reported common challenges such as syntax errors, debugging problems, and difficulty understanding program logic. These challenges affect students’ learning experiences and motivation, indicating that programming remains a demanding subject even at the Senior High School level.

Given these findings, it is important to further examine the experiences and motivation of ICT students in learning programming. Understanding the factors that influence students’ learning experiences can help improve teaching strategies and provide better support for learners. This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in programming to better understand the challenges they face and how these affect their learning.

### **Statement of the Problem**

This study aims to explore the experiences and motivation of Senior High School ICT students in learning programming.

Specifically, it seeks to answer the following questions:

1. What are the learning experiences of ICT students in programming?
2. What challenges do ICT students encounter while learning programming?
3. What motivates ICT students to learn programming?
4. How do students’ experiences influence their motivation in learning programming?

---

### **Conceptual Framework**

This study is anchored on the idea that students’ learning experiences influence their motivation in learning programming. The independent variables include students’ prior exposure to programming, learning challenges, and classroom experiences. These factors affect the dependent variable, which is the students’ motivation in learning programming. Motivation, in turn, influences students’ engagement and learning outcomes in ICT subjects.

### **Significance of the Study**

The findings of this study may benefit the following:

**Students.**
This study may help ICT students better understand their learning challenges and motivations in programming, allowing them to develop more effective learning strategies.

**Teachers.**
The results may guide ICT teachers in improving instructional methods, particularly in addressing difficulties such as debugging and syntax errors, and in enhancing student motivation.

**School Administrators.**
The study may provide insights that can help administrators design better ICT curricula and learning support programs.

**Future Researchers.**
This research may serve as a reference for future studies related to ICT education, programming instruction, and student motivation.

### **Scope and Limitations of the Study**

This study focuses on the experiences and motivation of Senior High School students under the ICT strand. It is limited to students currently enrolled during the specified school year. The study does not include other strands, advanced programming courses, or external factors outside the school environment.

#### **Foreign Studies**

Kori, Pedaste, Leijen & Tõnisson (2016) examined ICT students’ motivation differences based on prior programming exposure. The research found that students who learned programming before university had higher motivation and better academic results than those who began programming only at university, suggesting that early experience influences learning success in ICT programs. **Retrieved from https://www.ijiet.org/vol6/709-T0021.pdf**

Qian & Lehman (2017) reviewed misconceptions and other difficulties in introductory programming courses. They reported that novice learners often struggle with syntax errors, conceptual misunderstandings, and strategic knowledge application, all of which hinder learning progress and reduce confidence. **Retrieved from https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3077618**

A study published in Frontiers in Education (2022) showed that students’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations affected their engagement in programming and computational thinking. Prior programming experience was strongly linked to higher intrinsic  and better learning outcomes. **Retrieved from https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.948783/full**

Abdunabi (2024) found that programming self-efficacy and motivation predict academic success in ICT courses. Students with higher confidence and motivation demonstrated better performance and persistence in programming tasks. **Retrieved from https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1448912.pdf**

Cheah (2020) conducted a systematic review of programming learning difficulties and found that lack of problem-solving skills, poor instructional materials, and limited hands-on support contribute to learners’ struggles, which negatively affect motivation and engagement.

#### **Local Studies**

A research study at Palawan National School investigated the challenges that Grade 12 ICT programming students face, particularly in handling syntax errors and debugging activities. It found that these problems reduce students’ engagement and make learning more difficult, concluding that more practice and supportive tools are needed to improve their programming skills.
