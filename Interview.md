Lalo na't bago lang tayo, 'di natin alam paano mag-programming, paano mag-fine-tuning, at iba't ibang ICT techniques kung paano at anong tools i-import natin. 'Yun lang." |
|  |
| "Ah, mainly the lack of access and support po for ICT-focused subjects. Kasi for example po, hindi po gaano... for example po sa school natin, wala po tayong subjects that deal with programming. Meaning na kailangan ko po itong ipasok sa aking free time. And ayun po, when mostly school na po nagte-take up ng time ko, hindi ko na po minsan nakukuha 'yung time na i-develop 'yung skills na 'to." |

|  |
| "Because I have failed before. I would—I would want to try again and succeed at the next—succeed next time, next time." |
|  |
| "Ano po, 'yung experience influence them... it helps them to acquire more knowledge and skills." |
|  |
| "Ano po, 'yung... the more na marami ka pong nararanasan, mas marami ka pong natututunan. And then, mas lalo ka ring namo-motivate na gawin pa 'yung mga bagay-bagay na 'yun." |
|  |
| "Uhm, because you can gain more knowledge and also develop your skills in using a computer." |
|  |
| Uhm, because you can gain more knowledge and also develop your skills in computer—using a computer." |
|  |
| "Behavior po." |
|  |
| "Uhm, 'yung nakaka-influence po is 'yung ano po 'yung nagagawa po namin sa coding and 'yung behavior po." |
|  |
| "Yung imagination po namin para ma-create yung gusto naming gawin, and then yung behavior din po ng mga ICT students." |
|  |
| "It influence me by fixing my own account and other gadget issue." |
|  |
| "The student's experiencing... I'm experiencing struggling with the difficult concept about framing errors and bugging in the computer programming." |
|  |
| "By unlocking my old accounts po na nakalimutan ko po 'yung password para po mabawi ko. Tapos po, fixing the ano po, my computer issues." |
